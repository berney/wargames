# Vortex Level 10 â†’ Level 11

## Random?

Read in 20 integers and write the seed used to generate those numbers in unsigned little endian format. You have a time limit of 30 seconds to do this. You must login to vortex.labs.overthewire.org


# Notes

- I remember this level
- It is using a weak PRNG, not CSRNG, from memory it's a [Linear Congruential Generator(LCG)][LCG]
  - You can analyse the output and deduce the seed
    - I wrote a python script to do this, but I've lost it.
  - This [PRNG] wikipedia article is interesting about how 40 years on weak PRNG are still problems.
    - Better PRNG exist, such as Mersenne Twister, WELL, and xorshift
