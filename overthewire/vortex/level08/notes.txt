Reversing: -
  - Uses pthreads
  - Starts a thread running safecode()
    - Keeps looping print out a variable
  - Drops privileges, setting ruid, euid, suid, rgid, egid, rgid to uid, gid 
  - Calls unsafecode()
    - It's already dropped privs in this thread
    - Vulnerable to stackoverflow
        - Strcpy(buf_408, argv[1])
    - Can overwrite GOT/RELS or similar for library functions that privileged thread is making
      - I think shellcode will need to do do this hijacking of the GOT/RELS
      - pointing them the buffer with 2nd stage shellcode that drops shell
      - or if No-exec stack then malloc a RWX page and copy 2nd stage there
