# Notes

- very easy level
- I noticed that MotD banner ended with you have mail
  - couldn't read it with mail or mutt
  - I thought to myself I don't recall over levels saying that
    - I logged back into vortex8 to check and sure enought there's no "you have mail" line.
- Sure enought `/vortex/vortex9` is missing
- Check out the mail spool
  - Didn't even need to start hunting for SUID files with vortex9 group
